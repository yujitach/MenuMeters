    <dd>
        Fixed a serious bug in 2.0.8 where the app does not correctly work when the menubar is in the auto-hide mode.
        Unfortunately the autoupdater itself is not working for those affected by this bug.
        I am sorry about the mess, and I thank many people who reported the issue.
        (2.0.8.2 was a partial update which made things actually worse.)
