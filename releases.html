    <dt>2.0.8.2 (Nov/2/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        Fixed a serious bug in 2.0.8 where the app does not correctly work when the menubar is in the auto-hide mode.
        Unfortunately the autoupdater itself is not working for those affected by this bug.
        I am sorry about the mess, and I thank many people who reported the issue.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.0.8.1 (Oct/30/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        1. Fixed a bug in 2.0.8 on the dark mode support for pre-Mojave Macs.<br>
        2. Activity monitor panes are now selected correctly with Macs with discrete GPUs.<br>
        3. Forgot to say that 2.0.8 includes a new German localization thanks to <a href="https://github.com/schwedenmut">schwedenmut</a>.

    <dt>2.0.8 (Oct/28/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        1. You can now tint the colors toward black/white depending on whether the system is in the light/dark mode, using a slider.<br>
        2. Activity Monitor can now be opened from any MenuMeter.<br>
        3. Many other bug fixes.<br>
        4. Probably with new bugs, due to my ongoing rewrite of the internals toward Big Sur.

    <dt>2.0.6.1 (May/3/2020)</dt>
    <dd>
        This update contains the dark mode fix I intended to include in 2.0.6. (The original 2.0.6 actually made things worse due to my stupid last minute change.)

        Due to popular demand, you can now choose the interval to check the update. Also includes a fix for a dark mode bug.
